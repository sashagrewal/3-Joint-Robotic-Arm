# 3 Joint Robotic Arm With Claw
The project that I chose to build was the 3 joint robotic arm with claw and potentiometers. This robotic arm will function through the use of micro servo and potentiometers. This robotic claw will be able to hold different small objects.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was connecting a micro servo and potentiometer controlled via arduino. The micro servo and potentiometer were connected through a breadboard and the arduino. I used code written out in Arduino on my laptop to control the potentiometer and servo. The code essentially translated the potentiometer movements to the servo movemens so that these two seperate pieces were synched together. To do this there were several connections that I had to make either directly from potentiometer to servo or servo to arduino to potentiometer. Although I was successful in making these connnections at first the servo was not working properly. After carefully reviewing all my connections and making sure there were no small errors the servo was properly functioning.
