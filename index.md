# 3 Joint Robotic Arm With Claw
Hi, my name is Sasha! The project that I chose to build was the 3 joint robotic arm with claw and potentiometers. This robotic arm will function through the use of micro servo and potentiometers. This robotic claw will be able to hold different small objects.

# My project
Below is a picture of my completed robotic arm. This picture shows the actual robotic arm as well as the circuit board that have the potentiometers which control the robotic arm.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was building the actual robotic arm. For this I used all the pieces in the kit and put together the robotic arm. This arm is controlled by potentiometers and servos so I had to make sure all the connections were properly working. Another key component in building this arm was the arduino code being sent to the arm. In this code it established the servos and the rotation of each servo. The code also outlined the connections between the potentiometer and servo so the potentiometer could correctly control the servos. For this milestone one of the challenges that I faced was the servo was not properly functioning and rotating. This was a big challenge but after carefully checking my connections and making sure all the actual pieces were properly connected I was able toget the arm to properly work.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was connecting a micro servo and potentiometer controlled via arduino. The micro servo and potentiometer were connected through a breadboard and the arduino. I used code written out in Arduino on my laptop to control the potentiometer and servo. The code essentially translated the potentiometer movements to the servo movemens so that these two seperate pieces were synched together. To do this there were several connections that I had to make either directly from potentiometer to servo or servo to arduino to potentiometer. Although I was successful in making these connnections at first the servo was not working properly. After carefully reviewing all my connections and making sure there were no small errors the servo was properly functioning.

# Robotic Arm Code 

Below are pictures of my code I used to control the robotic arm. This code is through arduino and it controls both the micro servos in the arm and the potentiometers controlling the micro servos.
